## 🌟 What is Aang?

**Aang** is a playful, interactive web platform designed to teach **Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts to children aged 8–14** using games, stories, and visual coding.

Named after the beloved *Avatar: The Last Airbender* hero, Aang guides kids through AI adventures — from training chatbots to recognizing images — all without needing to write complex code!

Built with ❤️ using:
- **HTML** — for structure
- **CSS** — for colorful, kid-friendly styling
- **JavaScript** — for interactivity and AI logic

## 🧩 How It Works (Simplified)

1. **Kids choose an adventure** (e.g., “Help Aang find Appa using smart clues!”).
2. **They train AI** by giving examples — like showing 10 pictures of sky bisons.
3. **Aang learns** and starts recognizing new images or answering questions.
4. **Rewards & stories unlock** as they master each AI concept!

All logic runs in-browser — no servers needed for basic version!
